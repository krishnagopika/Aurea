Ibex API Developer Guide 
Welcome to the Ibex API - your comprehensive solution for accessing UK planning application data.
What is Ibex API? 
Ibex API is a comprehensive solution for accessing UK planning applications and property data. The API enables developers to build applications that require real-time access to planning and development data across the UK.
Key Features 
Planning Applications Search & Applications 
Search by Location: Find planning applications within a specified radius or polygon boundary
Search by Attributes: Retrieve planning applications filtered by council ID, date ranges, and various application attributes
Data Extensions: Request minimal data for speed when needed, or comprehensive data with additional metadata including heading, project_type, appeals, document_metadata, and extracted application form data
Flexible Filters: Filter by normalised_decision, keywords, normalised_application_type, project_type, and num_new_houses
